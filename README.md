# Challenger Insight:

Prototype predictive model for learner disengagement risk, using EEG brain-wave data and learner surveys. Applies dimensionality reduction and lightweight ML models to link cognitive load with engagement and provide adaptive learning triggers.

---

## Project Overview:
This project is part of **Break Through Tech AI Studio – Fall 2025**.  
Our team developed an interpretable system that processes EEG-signal data and learner surveys to build predictive models linking cognitive load to engagement.  
The goal is to proactively identify early signs of learner disengagement and recommend adaptive interventions that sustain participation, improve retention, and strengthen performance in advanced-tech learning environments.

---

## Objectives:
- **Goal 1:** Process and visualize EEG brain-wave data using dimensionality reduction.  
- **Goal 2:** Build a lightweight predictive model to anticipate learner disengagement.  
- **Goal 3:** Recommend adaptive content triggers to sustain learner engagement effectively.  

---

## Deliverables:
- Preprocessed EEG dataset and visualizations  
- Lightweight ML model prototype (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees)  
- Engagement risk prediction pipeline  
- Adaptive trigger recommendation framework  
- Documentation and final presentation  

---

## Desired Outcomes:
- Visual insights into brain-wave patterns indicating cognitive overload  
- Predictive analytics to identify engagement risks early  
- Actionable recommendations for adaptive, personalized learning triggers
